## In this project I do:

- set up with Webpack, Express, Node, and Sass, and Service Workers. Have separate dev and prod configurations for Webpack

- Retrieving data from 3 APIs: Geonames, Weatherbit and Pixabay, and one of those is reliant on another to work

- Use Sass for styling

- Response from the API added to the view for a user to see destination weather and image
